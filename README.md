# TRUNet
Semantic segmentation for 3D volume images using a modified ResNet50 v2 block and a Vision Transformer Block in a U-Net framework.

This is an adaptation of [TransUNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04306) for 3D inputs. Instead of the CNN encoder used in TransUNet the "Hybrid" approach including a modified RedNet50 block proposed by the authors is used.
